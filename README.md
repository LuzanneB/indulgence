<h2>Cuisi</h2>
<h1>Project Description -</h1>
<p>Cuisi is a home cooking online directory that allows users to search and filter for home chefs/bakers within a specific location that are proficient and available to supply a specific product based on the individuals needs.  As a user you can filter based on food category, location and turn around time to request a product to be made for you.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> - 
It's your daughters 1st birthday.  You would typically bake your own desserts for her party, but you have started a new job and have realized you won't have the time to get everything done.  You have a cake design in mind.  With Cuisi you are able to search for a baker in your area, view their profile which includes their cooking specialties and ratings (from other individuals who have previously used their services) and you can contact this baker to request their expertise.</p>
